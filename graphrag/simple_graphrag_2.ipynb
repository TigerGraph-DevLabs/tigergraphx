    "\n",
    "The query process of GraphRAG follows this workflow. TigerGraphX serves as the key interface, facilitating interaction with the embedding model to generate embeddings for user queries, retrieving context from TigerGraph, and communicating with the LLM chat model to generate answers.\n",

    "## Get the Graph from TigerGraph\n",
    "Since the graph has already been created in TigerGraph, redefining its schema is unnecessary. Instead, you can provide the graph name to retrieve it. TigerGraphX will verify if the graph exists in TigerGraph and, if it does, will return the corresponding graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define the TigerGraph Connection Configuration\n",
    "Before retrive the graph schema from TigerGraph, you shoulddefine the  TigerGraph Connection Configuration first.\n",
    "The recommended approach is to use environment variables, such as setting them with the `export` command in the shell. Here, to illustrate the demo, we configure them within Python using the `os.environ` method. You can find more methods for configuring connection settings in [Graph.\\_\\_init\\_\\_](../reference/01_core/graph.md#tigergraphx.core.graph.Graph.__init__)."

    "## Context Building: Writing Custom Context Builders\n",
    "\n",
    "Context builders play a vital role in graph-powered RAG workflows. They transform retrieved graph data into structured, meaningful contexts for tasks such as interactions with LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "TigerGraphX simplifies this process by offering the flexible `BaseContextBuilder` class, which allows developers to define custom logic for context building. You can find the source code in [this link](https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/tigergraphx/blob/main/tigergraphx/graphrag/base_context_builder.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a simple `ContextBuilder` by implementing the `build_context` method to define how the context is constructed. The process involves:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieving the top **k** relevant objects (products) using TigerGraph's vector search.  \n",
    "- For each retrieved product, fetching its properties and edges.  \n",
    "- Concatenating all the gathered information into a structured context and returning it.  "
