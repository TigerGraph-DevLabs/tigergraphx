    "# Supporting Microsoft’s GraphRAG: Part 2 - Graph Creation and Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous section](msft_graphrag_1.md), we used Microsoft's GraphRAG to convert unstructured documents into Parquet files, and then used TigerGraphX to transform these files into CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s use Jupyter Notebook to create the schema and load the CSV files into TigerGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this Jupyter Notebook, you can download the original `.ipynb` file from [msft_graphrag_2.ipynb](https://github.com/tigergraph/tigergraphx/tree/main/docs/graphrag/msft_graphrag_2.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Graph\n",
    "### Define the TigerGraph Connection Configuration\n",
    "Since our data is stored in a TigerGraph instance—whether on-premise or in the cloud—we need to configure the connection settings. The recommended approach is to use environment variables, such as setting them with the `export` command in the shell. Here, to illustrate the demo, we configure them within Python using the `os.environ` method. You can find more methods for configuring connection settings in [Graph.\\_\\_init\\_\\_](../reference/01_core/graph.md#tigergraphx.core.graph.Graph.__init__)."
